            <p>Tumors can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Benign tumors tend to grow slowly and do not spread. Malignant tumors can grow rapidly, invade and destroy nearby normal tissues, and spread throughout the body.</p>

            <p>One of the important steps in any statistical analysis is that of summarizing data. It is good practice to examine both a graphical and a numerical summarization of your data. These summaries are often part of the evidence that researchers use to support any conclusions drawn from the data. They also allow researchers to discover structure that might have otherwise been overlooked in the raw data that was actually collected. Lastly, both graphical and numerical summaries of the data often point to other analyses that may be undertaken with the data.</p>

            <h3>Machine Learning Models Used for Prediction Purposes. </h3>
            <form>
            <p>The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.
                1) The subarray which is already sorted. 
                2) Remaining subarray which is unsorted.
                In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.
                Following example explains the above steps: </p>
